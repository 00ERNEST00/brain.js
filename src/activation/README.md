# Activation Functions
An activation function is a very simple thing, essentially it is a means activation (trigger or squish) a larger number into a smaller one.
The terminology for activation functions are essentially:

* The equation: the actual activation function, for simplicity: "activate"
* The derivative: a means of comparing the the output of the activation function, for simplicity: "compare"
